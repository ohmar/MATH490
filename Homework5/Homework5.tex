%	PROBLEM 3.13
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\textbf{3.13} Access the horseshoe crab data of Table 3.2 at www.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/intro-c
da/appendix.html. \\
\textbf{a.} Using $x =$ weight and $Y =$ number of satellites, fit a Poisson loglinear
model. Report the prediction equation. \\

The prediction equation is $log(\hat{\mu}) = -0.428 + 0.589x$.
\\

\textbf{b.} Estimate the mean of $Y$ for female crabs of average weight $2.44$kg. \\

The mean of $Y$ for female crabs of average weight $2.44$ is $2.74$. \\
We find that by calculating $\hat{\mu} = e^{-.4284+.5893(2.44)}$
\\

\textbf{c.} Use $\hat{\beta}$ to describe the weight effect. Construct a $95$ percent conf
idence interval for $\beta$ and for the multiplicative effect of a 1 kg increase. \\

$\hat{\beta} = .5893$. Since it is positive, it tells us that there is an increase 
of satellites when there is an increase of weight. \\

The $95$ percent confidence interval calculates to $(0.462, 0.717)$ \\
We can calculate it manually in the following way, $0.589 \pm 1.96(0.0650)$
The confidence interval for the multiplicative effect is $(1.59, 2.05)$ \\

\textbf{d.} Conduct a Wald test of the hypothesis that the mean of $Y$ is independent of 
weight. Interpret. \\

To test that $Y$ is independent of $x$, we can use the hypothesis $H_0 : \beta = 0$.

We use the following equation, $Z^2 = (\hat{\beta}/SE)^2 = (.5893/.0650)^2 = 82.2$.
This tells us that there is extremeley strong evidence that weight will have a positive 
effect. \\

\textbf{e.} Conduct a likelihood-ratio test about the weight effect. Interpret. \\

The likelihood ratio test statistic is 71.925 with 1 degree of freedom. This tells us 
there is very strong evidence that weight has a positive effect.\\

%	PROBLEM 3.14
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\textbf{3.14} Refer to the previous exercise. Allow overdispersion by fitting the negativ
e binomial loglinear model. \\
\\

\textbf{a.} Report the prediction equation and the estimate of the dispersion parameter a
nd its $SE$. Is there evidence that this model gives a better fit than the Poisson model?
\\
The prediction equation is $log(\hat{\mu})= -.8647 + .7603(x)$. The estimate for the 
dispersion parameter is $.931$ and the standard error is $.168$. This suggests that there
is strong evidence for overdispersion. When compared to the Poisson model, this negative
binomial model provides a better fit. \\

\textbf{b.} Constuct a 95 percent confidence interval for $\beta$. Compare it with the on
e in (c) in the previous exercise. Interpret, and explain why the interval is wider with 
the negative binomial model. \\

The 95 percent confidence interval for this model is $(0.4207, 1.1136)$ The 95 percent 
confidence interval for the Poisson model is $(.462, .717)$. The interval is wider with 
the negative binomial model because it takes into account the overdispersion. The Poisson
model CI is too narrow because it does not take into account the overdispersion. \\

%	PROBLEM 3.18
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\textbf{3.18} Table 3.8 lists total attendance (in thousands) and the total number of arr
ests in a season for soccer teams in the Second Division of the British football league.
\\

\textbf{a.} Let $Y$ denote the number of arrests for a team with total attendance $t$. 
Explain why the model $E(Y) = \mu t$ might be plausible. Show that it has alternative form 
$log[E(Y)/t] = \alpha$, where $\alpha = log(\mu)$, and express this model with an offset 
term. \\

If $E(Y) = \mu t$ were the case, then that would mean that the attendance count is prop
ortional to the number of people arrested. \\ 

\textbf{b.} Assuming Poisson sampling, fit the model. Report and interpret $\hat{\mu}$.\\

Model fit here is $log[\hat{E}(Y)/t] = -.909$ with $SE = .022$ So, $\hat{\mu} = e^{-.909}
= .4029$ We can interpret this as saying that there are 0 arrests when attendance is zero
and about .4 arrests when attendance is one thousand, thus, for every thousand, arrests
 go up by about $0.4029$. \\

\textbf{c.} Plot arrests against attendance, and overlay the prediction equation. Use res
iduals to identify teams that had a much larger or smaller than expected number of arrest
s. \\

\begin{center}

\end{center}

I would say that the soccer teams Aston Villa, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Bradford City, 
and Shewsbury had the larger number of arrests, and Hull City, Millwal, Manchester City,
 Plymouth, and Stoke City has the smallest number of arrests. \\

\textbf{d.} Now fit the model $log[E(Y)/t] = \alpha$ by assuming a negative binomial dist
ribution. Compare $\hat{\alpha}$ and its \textit{SE} to what you got in (a). Base on this 
information and the estimate of the dispersion parameter and its \textit{SE}, does the Po
isson assumption seem appropriate? \\
